1. **Individual Permissions:**
   - `0`: No permission.
   - `1`: Execute permission. Allows the execution of a file, but not reading or writing.
   - `2`: Write permission. Allows writing to a file, but not reading or executing.
   - `4`: Read permission. Allows reading from a file, but not writing or executing.

2. **Four Digits in Permissions:**
   - **First Digit (Special Permissions):** Usually set to `0` in basic scenarios. It can also include special permissions like setuid, setgid, and sticky bit.
   - **Second Digit (User/Owner Permissions):** Specifies permissions for the file owner.
   - **Third Digit (Group Permissions):** Specifies permissions for users who are members of the file's group.
   - **Fourth Digit (Others Permissions):** Specifies permissions for all other users.

3. **Common Permission Combinations:**
   - `0644`:
     - Owner: Read and write (6 = 4 + 2).
     - Group: Read only (4).
     - Others: Read only (4).
     - Common for files that should be editable by the owner but only readable by others.
   - `0755`:
     - Owner: Read, write, and execute (7 = 4 + 2 + 1).
     - Group: Read and execute (5 = 4 + 1).
     - Others: Read and execute (5 = 4 + 1).
     - Common for directories and executable files that need to be accessible and executable by others.

These permission settings are crucial in Unix-like systems for managing access to files and directories. The owner, group, and others can each have a combination of reading, writing, and executing permissions, defined by the sum of `4` (read), `2` (write), and `1` (execute). The specific combination sets the level of access granted to each category of users.
